## Example Editor Extension Plugins 

This project contains several examples which extend the editor:

1. ExampleCommandPaneContent - Implements several commands which extend right click menus and the right rail of several nodes
2. ExampleDiagram - A simple Diagram editor without any semantics
3. ExampleDocument - A simple text editor which uses the SourceModel file format for persistence
4. ExampleNode - A example node which plugs into a VI and generates custom DFIR (execution code).
5. ExampleToolWindow - Implements a tool window pane that plugs into the editor.  This tool window tracks the current selection.
